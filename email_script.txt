Hi {firstname} {lastname},

This is just a quick email to better inform you about your current progress/grades in EECS 376. We've listed out your current grade totals in the table below.

Note that these grades only consider Homeworks 1-6 and we're only factoring in one drop. We're also assuming that you did the surveys so this may not be the most accurate estimation.

If you feel concerned about your grades, we're here to help! You can come to office hours to discuss anything about your grades or current progress.
